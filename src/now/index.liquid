    regionals are coming up, which I plan to get a few firsts in. I've also been studying for the

  <h2>Athletics 🏋️‍♂️</h2>

  <p>I just got finished with
    <em>wrestling</em>, and I started doing
    <em>shot put</em>
    and
    <em>discus</em>, so I'm trying to get back into the powerlifting mindset and solidify my technique for the throwing events</p>

  <p>I think I'll compete once I mature more in powerlifting, but I see no reason to compete until I get closer to my 16th birthday.</p>

  <h2>Doing ⌨️</h2>

  <p>Currently just trying to juggle everything at once. But I'm thinking about learning
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="rust">Rust</a>
    and trying to build some app with Rust frameworks for the sake of learning.
