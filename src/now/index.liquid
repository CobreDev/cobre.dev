  <h2>Academics 📚</h2>
  <p>Here's a list of the AP classes I'm taking right now:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AP Physics C: E&amp;M</li>
    <li>AP Physics C: Mechanics</li>
    <li>AP Biology</li>
    <li>AP World History: Modern</li>
    <li>AP Calculus BC</li>
  </ul>


  <p>E&M is definitely the hardest, but also the most intriguing for me.</p>

  <h2>Extracurriculars 🎓</h2>
  <p>There's an upcoming
    <a href="https://scioly.org/" class="arrow-external">Scioly</a>
    invitational, which I plan to sweep with 🥇. I've been studying for the
    <a href="https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2024/index.cfm" class="arrow-external">USAPhO</a>
    recently, and also expect to sweep the actual exam.</p>

  <h2>Athletics 🏋️‍♂️</h2>

  <p>I just got finished with
    <em>wrestling</em>, so I'm trying to get back into the powerlifting mindset and (hopefully) hit a
    <em>275lb</em>
    bench before Feb 1st (my 15th birthday).</p>

  <p>I think I'll compete once I can secure a
    <em>national</em>
    record, which will probably be the
    <em>bench</em>
    record (currently
    <em>314lb</em>). I already break the state-level
    <em>bench</em>
    and
    <em>squat</em>
    records, but I see no reason to compete until I get closer to my 16th birthday.</p>

  <h2>Doing ⌨️</h2>

  <p>Currently just trying to juggle everything at once. But I'm thinking about learning
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="rust">Rust</a>
    and trying to build some app with Rust frameworks for the sake of learning.
